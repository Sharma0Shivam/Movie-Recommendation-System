Movie-Recommendation-System

This project aims to develop a user-friendly movie recommendation system that 
provides accurate and relevant movie suggestions based on user input.

Objective of Project

This Movie Recommendation System focuses on achieving these primary objectives:
1. Personalized Recommendations
2. Movie Analysis
3. Feature Extraction
4. Similarity computation

Algorithms Used

The algorithm used in this movie recommendation system is Content-Based Filtering, a 
technique that recommends items based on their features. In this case, textual features of movies, 
such as descriptions or summaries, are used to create a representation of each movie. This representation is then compared using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document 
Frequency) to find similarities between movies.
